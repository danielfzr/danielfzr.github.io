        <p style="text-align:center;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif sc;font-size:18px;"> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Junior at the University of Texas at Austin double majoring in Corporate Finance and Economics. I am from Bogot√°, Colombia but moved to The Woodlands, TX in 2007 with my family and lived there ever since. I have two older brothers and one little brother and at home a little dog named Lilo. I am a big movie fan and am looking forward to going back to movie theatres, additionally, I love staying active and spending time with family and friends. I spent most of my time either at work, at the gym or on campus, but when I'm not busy I like to go bouldering or biking around Austin. </p>
